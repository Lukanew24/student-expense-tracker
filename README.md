# Student Expense Tracker (Updated)

This React Native project allows students to track their daily expenses using a simple and clean interface.  
Expenses are stored locally using **Expo SQLite**, and the app includes features for adding, viewing, and deleting expenses.

This updated version enhances the original project by improving UI theme consistency and organizing components for better readability.

Copilot Reflection
I used copilot to help come up with the code for giving me my color layout it helped save a lot of time that way.
The prompt was along the lines of "Give me a theme with sand brown and dark brown as the app layout."
The change that I rejected was trying to change the title of the app, the copilot ended up making the app not working so I had to fight with github to go back a commit because I wasn't able to fix it somehow.
